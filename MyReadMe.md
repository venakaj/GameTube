    Import the UserModule in the AppModule then list it in the imports.

    Note : The BrowserModule should only be imported in the root module. Other modules should import CommonModule instead.

# Navigation component
    ng g c nav

# Auth modal
    ng g c user/auth-modal

    ng g m shared
    ng g c shared/modal
    Note : The shared module should define components, pipes anƒè directives for different parts of our app.
